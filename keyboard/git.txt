-- ordinary maintenance:
git status
(git add .)
git commit -am "some text"
git push origin master
-- to sync if remote is newer:
git pull
-- to sync from father:
(git remote add upstream http://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard)
git remote -v
git fetch upstream
git checkout master
git merge | rebase upstream/master
(maybe even git pull upstream master ??)
resolve conflicts! when all is set clean you can as well
git push origin master
probably you even need to force it if rebased:
git push -f origin master
